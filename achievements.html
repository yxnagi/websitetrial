            BOXING ACHIEVMENTS

        <p class="textstyle1">Cassius Clay started training for boxing at the age of 12. He made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against Ronnie O’Keefe, a bout he won by split decision. 
            Then, before the age of 18, he went on to win six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles and two Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) national 
            titles. However, his greatest achievement as an amateur boxer was winning the Gold Medal in the light heavyweight division (178-pound division) at the 1960 Summer
            Olympics held in Rome. Clay won his first three fights at the Olympics with two unanimous decisions and a second-round knockout. In the final, he faced three-time 
            European champion Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of Poland. After being dominated by his opponent in the first two rounds, Clay found top form in the 
            third round mauling his opponent and almost securing a knock-out. Clay was declared winner by all the judges making him the light heavyweight Olympic champion.</p>

            TITLE CHAMPION

            Muhammad Ali was the first man to win the heavyweight title three times
            In 1978, Leon Spinks defeated Muhammad Ali in a split decision to become the heavyweight champion in what was considered one of the 
            biggest upsets in boxing history. A rematch occurred on September 15, 1978. Despite being well past his prime, Ali returned to the ring well-conditioned and 
            focused. Over 15 rounds, he outclassed Spinks and won by a unanimous verdict. This victory made Muhammad Ali the first man to win the heavyweight title three times. 
            He remains the only three-time lineal World Heavyweight Champion. Muhammad Ali retired for good in December 1981. During his professional career spanning 61 fights, 
            he won 56 bouts including 37 knockouts; and lost 5 times. Ali won twenty-two World Heavyweight Championship fights. He made a total of nineteen successful title 
            defences, nine during his first reign and ten during his second reign. He was also the first World Heavyweight Champion to come back from retirement and regain the 
            title.</p>

            PEOPLES CHAMPION
        </h1>
        <p class="textstyle1">
            In 1967, Muhammad Ali shocked the world when he refused to report after being drafted into the US military. The reasons he cited for his action was his religious 
            beliefs and opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War. He also pointed out that Black men were disproportionally drafted and killed in Vietnam, while 
            those who returned after fighting heroically still faced racism in their own country. At the trial on June 20, 1967, the jury found Ali guilty of draft evasion. 
            He was stripped of his boxing title and was banned from boxing. Ali’s stance was controversial as well as brave because there was widespread support for the 
            Vietnam War at the time. However, with time, Ali’s actions as a conscientious objector to the war made him an icon for countless black Americans and others. 
            Moreover, Muhammad Ali was also a high-profile figure of racial pride for 
            African Americans during the civil rights movement. On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Ali’s conviction by a unanimous verdict.
